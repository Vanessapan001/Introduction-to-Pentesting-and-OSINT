# Introduction-to-Pentesting-and-OSINT

Objectives of this article:
1. Understand the role of a pentester in assessing a business's security.
2. Collect domain information using OSINT techniques and tools like Google dorking, Shodan, and certificate transparency.
3. Use Shodan and Recon-ng to discover domain server information.

****PLEASE DO NOT practice these techniques against computers that you do not own or have clear written permission to interact with.******

Penetration testing, often referred to as pentesting or ethical hacking, is the offensive security practice of attacking a network using the same techniques that a malicious hacker would use, in an effort to identify security holes and raise awareness within an organization.

An engagement consists of five phases: Planning and Reconnaissance, Scanning, Exploitation, Post Exploitation, and Reporting.

During the planning phase, the engagement's scope and purpose are defined.

The scope includes the type of penetration test that will be run. Types include: no view, full view, and partial view.

# MITRE ATT&CK

The company MITRE developed the MITRE ATT&CK matrix to provide a visual representation of the most popular techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) that may be performed throughout an assessment.

MITRE ATT&CK is a “hacker’s playbook.”

The matrix is comprehensive, meaning that virtually every potential attack falls under a tactic and maps to a specific technique.

As a penetration tester, it’s beneficial to map out the techniques that you performed in an assessment so that the customer can learn which TTPs were successful and what needs to be addressed.


# Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance, or recon, means gathering information about your target.

Reconnaissance is divided into two types:

1. `Passive Recon`

Often refers to open source intelligence (OSINT), which leverages information about the target that is publicly available on the internet. This includes all domains and hosts belonging to a target that are publicly viewable.

2. `Active Recon`

Also refers to gathering information about the target, but active reconnaissance involves directly interacting with the target.

Reconnaissance can be conducted:

# Google Dorking

A reconnaissance tactic that enables us to manipulate Google searches to narrow down our queries in order to acquire actionable intel.



# Certificate transparency

Certificate issuers publish logs of SSL/TLS certificates that they issue to organizations. This is known as certificate transparency. 

A reconnaissance tactic where a penetration tester can gather information from certificate issuers, which publish logs of the SSL/TLS certificates that they issue to organizations.


# Shodan

Shodan.io conducts port scanning across the entire internet and catalogs the results for quick searching. 

A reconnaissance website that conducts port scanning across the entire internet and catalogs the results for quick searching.


# Recon-ng

Recon-ng is a web reconnaissance framework written in Python.

The Recon-ng framework ingests many popular OSINT modules, allowing the results of multiple tools to be combined into a single report.
